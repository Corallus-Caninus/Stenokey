DO NOT PRINT ALL OF THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY!

DO NOT PRINT SINGLE KEYS!  Always print at least two keys at a time 
to avoid over heating and distortion of the key stems.  Always 
print with the printer's cooling fan enabled above the first layer, 
(for the same reason).

A standard steno keyboard consists of 10 sets of 3 consonant keys 
and a set of 4 vowel keys.  This can be obtained by printing 10 
copies of the files that are named with a "Finger" prefix (in any workable combination) plus the Vowels file.  Note that some 
combinations of wide and double wide keys cannot be fit next to 
each other on the keyboard.  

## Print Instructions

The Stenokey key tops were printed successfully under the 
following conditions:

Nozzle:  0.4 mm  
Layer:  0.2 mm  
Filament:  PLA, modified  
Extruder:  Follow filament manufacturer's temperature recommendation.  
Heated bed: 50° to 60° C  
Interior:  50% infill  
Exterior: 100% infill, 0.8 mm thick (4 layers) top and bottom, 
double shell (0.8 mm)  
No Raft

Allow plenty of room between rows of key tops when printing 
parts without extensions.  It may be almost impossible to 
remove the parts otherwise.  Allow the bed to cool below the 
filament's glass temperature before removing parts to avoid 
bending and ruining them. 
  
Once printed, the keys should fit snugly into the plungers of the 
Matias key switches, so that they don't fall out.  If you have difficulty inserting a key into a key switch, use a fingernail 
file on the key stem to reduce its size.  Usually a couple of 
swipes of a file on each face of the key stem is sufficient.

## Directory Contents

File naming convention:

- "Vowels" -- This file contains 4 narrow vowel keys.

- "Finger" -- All of these files contain 3 consonant keys, upper, 
middle and lower.

- "Key" -- All of these files contain a single key only.

- "Narrow" -- The key or keys in these files are the standard key 
width.

- "Double" -- The key or keys in these files have extra width on 
both the left and the right.

- "WideLeft" -- The key or keys in these files have extra width on 
the left side.

- "WideRight" -- The key or keys in these files have extra width on 
the right side.

- "WideCenter" -- The key or keys in these files have their extra 
width split evenly on the left and the right.

- "Extended" -- The key or keys in these files have extensions on 
their stems, so that they are raised up above the vowel keys.

- "Upper" -- The key in these files is used in the upper consonant 
row on the steno keyboard.

- "Middle" -- The key in these files is used in the middle 
consonant row on the steno keyboard.

- "Lower" -- The key in these files is used in the lower consonant 
row on the steno keyboard.  Any of the lower keys (without 
extensions) can also be used as vowel keys.

The TestStand.stl file is provided to make it easier to check the 
fit of the key stems in a Matias key switch.  You may need to 
scrape the inside edges of the opening in the test stand with a 
sharp knife to fit a key switch into the stand.
