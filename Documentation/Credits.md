# 3D Models

- KMR2 switch model was downloaded from CKSwitches.com.  
- M3 screw model was downloaded from TracePartsOnline.com.  
- Matias key switch model was downloaded from Matias.ca.  
- USB Mini-B model was downloaded from TracePartsOnline.com.  

These models were used generate a full 3D model of the Stenokey to aid in the design of the Stenokey case.

# Fonts (not included)

- Criovision font, by Criovision Agency was downloaded from dafont.com.  The Criovision font was used for the Stenokey logo.

# Tools (not included)

- Arduino IDE -- Arduino programming environment (open source).  The Arduino IDE is used to program the Teensy 2.0.  It was also used to edit and test the Stenokey firmware.  
- DraftSight -- 2D drafting program (free).  DraftSight was used to draw the key and case outlines for use in OpenSCAD.   
- FreeCAD -- 3D drawing program (open source).  FreeCAD was used to view and troubleshoot several .STL files and some of the Stenokey OpenSCAD code.  It was also used to convert files in other 3D formats to .STL format for use with OpenSCAD.  
- FreeRouting -- PCB Auto-routing program (open source).  FreeRouting was used to route the Stenokey PCB.
- Gerbv -- Gerber viewer (open source).  Gerbv (not Gerbview) was used view and verify the Stenokey PCB design.  
- Git -- Revision control system (open source).  Git provides version control.  
- Inkscape -- 2D graphic design program (open source).  Inkscape was used to draw the Stenokey logo.  
- KiCAD -- printed circuit board design software (open source).  KiCAD was used to design the Stenokey PCB.  
- MarkDownPad -- markdown editor and viewer (free -- Windows only).  MarkdownPad was used to format many of the Stenokey documents.  
- Netfabb -- 3D printer design software (free version).  Netfabb was used to obtain measurements from .STL files and to fix errors in .STL files.  
- Plover -- Stenographic translation program (open source).  Plover was used to troubleshoot the Stenokey firmware.  
- OpenOffice -- office utilities (open source).  Open office Calc was used for the Stenokey bill of materials (BOM). 
- OpenSCAD -- 3D drawing program (open source).  OpenSCAD was used to draw all of the Stenokey 3D printed parts.  
- SVG2MOD -- graphic conversion program for KiCAD (open source).  SVG2MOD was used to convert the Stenokey logo from SVG format to a KiCAD module (footprint).  The KiCAD module was hand edited to convert it to .kicad_wks format. 
- TeensyDuino -- Arduino compatible library and utilities (free).  The TeensyDuino libraries are used in the Stenokey firmware.  The Teensy utility is used to program the Teensy 2.0 module.  

# Documents (not included)

- Stenosaurus Keyboard Design was downloaded from stenosaurus.blogspot.ca.  The Stenokey key shapes and general board layout were essentially copied from the Stenosaurus project.
- Matais key switch prints were downloaded from matias.ca.  The prints were used to obtain key switch dimensions.
